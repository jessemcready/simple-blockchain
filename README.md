# Why
This was a learning experience to better understand how blockchain technology. I followed a YouTube series by Simply Explained - Savjee. The link to the first video in the 3 part series can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124).

# How
Using JavaScript and SHA256, we created a simple blockchain. Each block also comes with a "proof of work" function called __mineBlock(difficulty)__ . This determines how long it should take in order to add new blocks to the chain.

# Future of the project
I only did up to part 2 as of this commit, so I did not implement rewards for mining blocks.  In the future I'd like to do the proof of work rewards and also how to actually run this chain on a peer to peer network with a consensus of sorts.
